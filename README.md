# CodeMap Diagnostic

**[Documentation](https://docs.rs/codemap-diagnostic)**

A Rust library for formatting compiler error messages,
[extracted from rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc_errors)
and built on the types from the [codemap](https://github.com/kevinmehall/codemap) crate.

## Deprecated

This crate is deprecated. I recommend choosing another library, such as

* [annotate-snippets-rs](https://crates.io/crates/annotate-snippets)
* [codespan-reporting](https://crates.io/crates/codespan-reporting)
* [ariadne](https://crates.io/crates/ariadne)
* [miette](https://crates.io/crates/miette)
